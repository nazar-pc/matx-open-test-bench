# Micro ATX open test bench

Basic test bench for standard Micro ATX motherboard designed for 3D printing without supports.

It only has motherboard tray and support for 4 expansion cards.
No I/O shield or anything else, has cut-out on the back for easier cooler and back SSD access (if any).

## Printing and usage

I was printing it with 1mm nozzle, 0.5m layer height and 30% infill in PLA on Creality CR-5 Pro H.

Motherboard can be secured with M3 screws and expansion cards with 6-32 screws like most standard cases.
They will tap right in, no need for inserts or anything.
